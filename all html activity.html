	<H1><b><P>Here is a quote from WWF s website:</p><b></h1>

	<blockquote>
 cite="https://niit.lk/" Sri Lanka assaulted our senses the moment we stepped outside the airport in Colombo and into the humid, lotus-scented air. Every scrap of earth not covered by pavement lay underwater or pushed up something green, or both. Even at 3:30 in the morning, after 30 hours of traveling, even with armed soldiers crisscrossing the departing lanes of traffic, the night pulsed with vegetable life, the squawks of birds, the bellows of frogs. I felt the fragility of human civilization when measured against the strength of nature, this jungle breathing all around us, waiting to reclaim its island.Enclosed again in the car with our driver, leaving the airport, I saw my first Buddhist shrine within five minutes. First a light appeared in the darkness, then a white Buddha statue sitting in a glass box, deep in contemplation, hove into view.
